# JD Creation Interface

A voice-powered job description creation interface built with Next.js 14, Pipecat Voice UI Kit, and real-time editing capabilities.

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete âœ…

### Features Implemented

- **Two-Panel Layout**: Voice chat on the left, live JD editor on the right
- **Voice Integration**: Pipecat Voice UI Kit with SmallWebRTC transport
- **Real-time Editor**: Rich text editor with Tiptap and live updates
- **State Management**: Jotai atoms for shared state between voice and editor
- **API Integration**: WebRTC endpoint that proxies to Python server
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with modern UI components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Server**: Ensure your Python server is running on port 7860
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   python bot.py
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Configure your `.env.local` file with API keys

### Running the Interface

1. **Install Dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Usage

1. **Connect Voice**: Click the connect button in the left panel
2. **Start Speaking**: Describe your job requirements
3. **See Live Updates**: Watch the job description update in real-time on the right
4. **Edit Manually**: Use the tabbed editor to refine sections
5. **Export**: Use the export buttons to save as PDF or Markdown

### Voice Integration
- Uses Pipecat Voice UI Kit for voice interface
- SmallWebRTC transport for real-time communication
- Connects to Python server at `localhost:7860/offer`
- Real-time transcription and command processing

### State Management
